- Log editor can also count the words in your log text and predict the "The Author" badge that you will earn
- Hints can be decrypted automatically without clicking on "Decrypt" (can be changed in the settings)
- Almost everything in this feature list can be configured and enabled/disabled in the settings of this extension.
